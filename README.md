# DataPrivacy
Those scripts shows how to strengthen privacy. There are used two options: perturbating method (adding noise to orginal data) and encrypting (perturbated data is encrypthed). Using perturbating method, the privacy of orginal data and the privacy of the model based on original data are protected. Script using perturbating method (data_privacy.py) also shows the diffrences between created models: one using orginal data and the second one using synthetic data. Used dataset comes from sklearn.datasets and is named load_breast_cancer.
